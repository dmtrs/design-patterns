# SternBrocot tree

> Mathematics has long played an important role in timekeeping as cultures created calendars to express their unique values. In this article, we will look at an interesting mathematical construction, the SternBrocot tree, that was created, in part, to help build timepieces. As we'll see, the tree gives an exceptionally elegant way to enumerate the positive rational numbers and is a surprisingly useful tool for constructing clocks.

> Moritz Stern, a German mathematician who succeeded Gauss at the University of GÃ¶ttingen first described the tree and explained its relation to other topics in number theory in a mathematics paper in 1858.

> Stern's codiscoverer , Achille Brocot, was born into an esteemed family of clockmakers in 1817, and later held several patents on his work. Our focus here, however, will be on his discovery of the SternBrocot tree and its use in clock making.
